FUNCTIONALITY

This scripts will find objects in the target directory that matched the source's --sIdentifiers.
When this match is found the source attributes in --sAttributes are create (or overriden when --replace is used)
on the found target object.

Use case example:
You need to copy the email addresses and descritpion in your HR objects on the Azure directory, where they are missing. 
And the mail in local directory is mapped to emailAddress in Azure
And the description in local directory is mapped to description in Azure
In this use case we can uniquely identify a user in HR directory with the uid which for example is matched in Azure to userId.

You would start the script as follows:

./ldap-bulkcopy.py  --sLdap="ldap://127.0.0.1/" \
          --sBind="cn=admin,dc=phonax" \
          --sPass="Phonax01" \
          --sBaseDN="ou=source,ou=users,dc=phonax" \
          --sAttribs="mail, description" \
          --sIdentifiers="(uid=[uid])(gidNumber=[gidNumber])" \
          --sFilter="(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(cn=*))" \
          --dLdap=ldap://127.0.0.1 \
          --dBind="cn=admin,dc=phonax" \
          --dPass="Phonax01" \
          --dBaseDN="ou=dest,ou=users,dc=azure" \
          --dAttribs="emailAddress, description" \
          --dFilter="(&(objectClass=user)[sIdentifiers])" 


STARTING THE SCRIPT

ldap_enrich takes certain specified attributes from one object and copies them to another objects

Usage: ldap-bulkcopy.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --sLdap=SOURCE        LDAP url of source
  --sBind=SOURCEBIND    source bind
  --sPass=SOURCEPASS    source password
  --sBaseDN=SBASEDN     source password
  --sAttribs=SATTRIBS   comma seperated attributes to copy (this list matched 1 to 1 in order with the --dAttribs)
  --sFilter=SFILTER     source filter which objects to select
  --dLdap=DEST          LDAP url of destination
  --dBind=DESTBIND      dest bind
  --dPass=DESTPASS      dest password
  --dBaseDN=DBASEDN     source password
  --dFilter=DFILTER     destination filter that should contain [sIdentifiers] tag to uniquely find matching
                        object in destination directory. F.i: (&(objectClass=user)[sIdentifiers])
                        Where [sIdentifiers] will be replaced with evaluated --sIdentifiers
  --dAttribs=DATTRIBS   comma seperated attributes to be copied (matching 1 to
                        1 with sAttrib)
  --sIdentifiers=SIDENTIFIERS
                        LDAP search string template to uniquely identify a user in 
                        destination directory; f.i. (uid=[uid])(groupNumber=[gidNumber] 
                        where [uid] and [gidNumber] are replace with the source's attribute values
                        is changed with source value
  -r, --replace         replace destination attributes when they differ
                        between source and dest, default is false
  -t, --simulate        Only print output the unencoded LDIF output, for
                        inspection and will not update the directory


ATTRIBUTE ONE TO ONE MAPPING

The source attribute list matches one to one the destination attribute list.
This allows you to copy a source attribute value to a destination attribute with a different name.

For example:
-sAttribs='loginShell, uid'
-dAttribs='loginShell, description'
Would copy the source value in loginShell to the attribute loginShell in the destination,
And copies the uid value from the source object to the destimation object's description field.
NOTE: THEREFORE THERE ARE ALWAYS THE SAME AMOUNT OF ATTRIBUTES IN THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION
